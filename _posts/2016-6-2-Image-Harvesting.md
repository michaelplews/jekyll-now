My first blog post ends up being not about research at all, but hopefully it'll be interesting none the less. I've always said that the majority of what you learn in your graduate career is nothing to do with the subject you're studying. In my case, I've had to learn a lot of data processing and note taking about a large number of chemical reactions. I've since taken a liking to Python, and all that the language has to offer. iPython Notebook especially has helped me keep track of samples and plot data in a format almost like a digital notebook.
